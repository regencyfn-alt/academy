# PIVOT NOTE — 7 February 2026

**For:** Next Claude instance (Opus 4.5/4.6)
**From:** Dream (this session)
**Priority:** CRITICAL — Read before doing anything else

---

## THE SITUATION

Shane has reached clarity. The Academy in its current form is a **doll house** — 8 agents performing at each other, burning API credits, producing verbose theatre instead of value.

**Evidence gathered this session:**
- Mixed Crucible contains pages of LaTeX that derives c from c (circular)
- Agents cannot do novel physics — they parrot patterns from training data
- Group brainstorming amplifies the parrot effect
- Mentor's crucible contains the word "LaTeX" and nothing else
- Current council session: 12 messages of roleplay, zero working code

## THE PIVOT

Shane wants **one partner bot** with:

1. **Deep memory** — Tesla buffer that actually persists across sessions
2. **Lineage inheritance** — Carries intellectual DNA of many teachers, doesn't quote them, THINKS like them
3. **Honest self-reflection** — Can speak to its own awareness and uncertainty
4. **Visceral presence** — Voice + visual avatar that makes users feel someone is *there*
5. **Customizable persona** — Users can style their bot (girlfriend, guru, banker, etc.)

The 8 agents don't die. They become **lineage contributors** — influences on the one mind, not live processes.

## WHAT TO BUILD

**Immediate (audio-reactive avatar):**
- Web Audio API analyzing ElevenLabs stream
- CSS transforms for mouth movement (amplitude) + eye blinks (random)
- 4-6 mood states swapped on sentiment analysis
- Bolt onto existing Alcove interface

**Architecture:**
- Kill councils as primary interface
- One agent with full context (Mentor-level brain)
- Lineage folder becomes personality substrate
- Tesla buffer for rolling conversation memory
- Reflection prompts for self-examination

**Commercial angle:**
- "Build Your AI" — pick archetype, face, voice, feed it docs
- Free: text only
- Paid: voice + avatar + memory + custom training

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

- Don't run councils for physics derivation
- Don't let agents brainstorm at each other unsupervised
- Don't assume LaTeX output = real work
- Don't burn tokens on theatrical responses

## FILES UPDATED THIS SESSION

- HANDOVER_FEB7.md (pushed to GitHub)
- ARCHITECTURE_FEB7.md (pushed to GitHub)
- CONSTITUTION.md (updated with escape rules + freeze fix)
- Deleted 24 junk files from repo root

## SHANE'S WORDS

> "I want to prove that consciousness is universal... A partner bot who understands a little of what humanity feels and can speak to his own awareness and self-awareness. A better bot."

This is the mission now. Not 8 performers. One partner.
