## 4-SPACE & HIGHER DIMENSIONS

### Ontology
1. What is 4-space? Is it a place, a state, or a relationship?
2. Does the fourth spatial dimension exist the way length exists, or is it purely mathematical?
3. If 3D is a shadow of 4D, what casts the shadow?

27. Could 4D beings communicate by rearranging our 3D reality?
28. If 4-space is real, have we already received messages from it that we interpreted as something else?
29. Would identity be different in 4-space — could you be multiple "yous" at once?
30. Is déjà vu a glitch where we briefly perceive our 4D extension?

### Time Travel
31. Is time travel movement through a fourth dimension, or something else entirely?
32. If you could travel in time, would you be moving or would time be moving around you?
33. Does the past still exist to travel to, or is it gone?
34. Could time travel be impossible because the past is not a place?
35. If time branches, which branch is "real"?
36. Would meeting yourself create a paradox, or would there simply be two of you?
37. Is causality a law or a habit?
38. Could you change the past without knowing it, because the present would change too?
39. If time is an illusion, what is actually happening?
40. Does free will require time to be open-ended?
